## Key performance Indicators (KPIs)

### Education Access Rate (EAR)

<!-- It would be good to place a value proposition to measuring this in this space.  For example: -->
Measuring the Education Access Rate provides a framework for assessing progress, identifying disparities, informing policy, and fostering inclusivity in education, ultimately contributing to sustainable development and social equity.

Summary Details:
* Calculates the proportion of kids with primary and secondary school enrollment.
* Goal: - 95% worldwide enrollment rate

<!-- Repeat for the KPIs below -->
### Gender Parity Index (GPI)

The GPI is a measure used to assess the relative access to education between genders. It is calculated by dividing the number of female students by the number of male students in a specific educational level. A GPI of 1 indicates gender parity, while values below or above 1 highlight disparities. This index is vital for monitoring progress toward gender equality in education (aligned with UN SDG #4), identifying gaps, and informing policies aimed at promoting equal access and opportunities for all genders in educational settings.

Summary Details:
* Compares the rates of education enrollment for men and women.
* Goal: At every level, reach a ratio of 1.0 (equal access).

### Literacy Rate (LR)

* Proportion of the people with basic reading and writing skills.
* The goal is to raise global literacy rates to 90%.

### School Completion Rate (SCR)

* Determines what proportion of students finish each educational level.
* Goal: 85% of secondary school students should finish.

### Education Investment Index (EII)

* Calculates the proportion of GDP allocated to education by the government.
* Goal: Education should account for at least 4% of GDP.
