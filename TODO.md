* Think about a storyboard to prep for what you hope to visualize.  E.g. line chart over time showing top 5 countries most in need of course correction
* Think about other data that may be influential when we do our ML and regression analysis.  E.g. Does a country's GDP correlate with low education scores, how about percent of the population with internet access.  The more factors we have here, the better.
* Tighten up your markdown, I made some corrections but not all.
* Download the data, and put it in the "data" directory.
* Put code in the code directory
